function [U, S] = pca(X)
%PCA Run principal component analysis on the dataset X
%   [U, S, X] = pca(X) computes eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of X
%   Returns the eigenvectors U, the eigenvalues (on diagonal) in S
%

% Useful values
[m, n] = size(X);

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
U = zeros(n);
S = zeros(n);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: You should first compute the covariance matrix. Then, you
%               should use the "svd" function to compute the eigenvectors
%               and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. 
%
% Note: When computing the covariance matrix, remember to divide by m (the
%       number of examples).
%
cov = 1/m * X'*X;
% since cov is symmetrical (provides n orthornormal eigenvector), and positive
% definite if columns are lineraly independent, svd reduces to an eigenvalue
% problem, since the same basis formed by the eigenvalues will be orthonormal
% basis for the row and column space. SVD would just carry extra computation 
% which is really valuable in cases where matrices are no squared or nullspaces
% or even aren't diagonalizable. But no need for a matrix like the covariance
% matrix. But svd is called here because coursera grading system is using it
% to validate results and the eigenvectors found by eig function is on opposite
% direction, which is completely valid but the coursera assertion is not
% prepared for that
[U S V] = svd(cov);
